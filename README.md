# Rock Paper Scissors

This program intends to function as a simple game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' (more infomation can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

Languages Used: ECMAScript (Javscript)

Gotchas: I learned a great deal about optimization though this project.  Imagining how a user would encounter prompts and respond to them demanded some additional work.  For instance, a user could enter 'abc123rock' for their input, and I would need to determine if 'rock' would be accepted from this.  Considering the myopic goal of the project, I decided to restrict input to 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' using regular expressions, which turned out to be a wonderful exercise in this.  After learning so much about regular expressions, it was incredible how much referencing was used when implimenting components for the first time, demonstrating the difference between learning and practicing.  I believe giving myself more opportunities to explain and implement learned programming concepts is wise, and I'm glad I undertook these additional measures here to expand my practical knowlege.

What could be improved: I could possibly include a button to submit responses, or use a table to express the current and final tally of the game.  This is a small fraction of what could be improved, but much else would be an overreach for what the project was hoping to instill in me as a learner.
